# this PLANNER

This is the official repository for **this PLANNER**, a minimalist day planner.

This book is available for purchase on lulu.com, proceeds go toward the development of **this PLANNER**.

## About the project

This project is the result of a planner which I designed for my personal use.
I decided on a minimalist approach for a few reasons.
I think a minimal layout leave room for personal interpretation.
**this PLANNER** is undated and has no headings on ruled sections (like goals, lists, etc).
This leaves plenty of room for your specific use case.

The "source code" is being released to allow a person to customize the pages for their own particular use case as long as they print it "at home" and not through a custom printer.
The source documents are created in Scribus, an open source desktop publishing application available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
Its file format is XML, so it is a perfect candidate for source control.

**this PLANNER** is the first community-driven dayplanner.
Development takes place right here on GitHub, and you can buy the current major version on lulu.
If you are interested in contributing to the project, please see the [Contributing](#Contributing) section.
